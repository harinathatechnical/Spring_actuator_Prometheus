# Spring_actuator_Prometheus

Spring Boot Actuator module helps you monitor and manage your Spring Boot application by providing production-ready features like health check-up, auditing, metrics gathering, HTTP tracing etc. All of these features can be accessed over JMX or HTTP endpoints.

Actuator also integrates with external application monitoring systems like Prometheus, Graphite, DataDog, Influx, Wavefront, New Relic and many more. These systems provide you with excellent dashboards, graphs, analytics, and alarms to help you monitor and manage your application from one unified interface.

Actuator uses Micrometer, an application metrics facade to integrate with these external application monitoring systems. This makes it super easy to plug-in any application monitoring system with very little configuration.
